Please Note:\n1. Sonar JIRAs are assigned to the developer who caused the violation or the component owner (In case the original developer is not with Breeze anymore)\n2. If you think, some JIRA is assigned to you by mistake, please visit check Component Ownership and assign it to correct owner.\n3. If it is not possible to fix any particular violation (E.g. SONAR says not to use S.O.P. but there is no logger available and you have to use S.O.P.), then please add NOSONAR comment and provide the explanation in JIRA comments before resolving the JIRA.
